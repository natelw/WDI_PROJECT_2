**Introduction -**


Lair is a web app to create and store character sheets for dungeons and dragons. It is created using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js. I used the materialize framework.

**Concept -**


In a Game of Dungeons and Dragons, a table top roleplaying game, you often have a lot of information that you need kept safe to play the game. This is my solution to housing character sheets in a cool modern style, easily accessable on the web.

**Technologies used -**
 

* MongoDB and Mongoose
* Express.js
* Angular
* Node.js
* Materalize
* SASS


**What went well -**
I enjoyed creating this site. Getting to grips with Materialize was great. I particularly liked the button menu in the bottom right of the app. Creating a design that worked as navigation throughout. 
On the back end it was good to use restful routes and get a deeper understanding of the MVC model.

**Challenges -**
Making the app responsive was a challenge and with more time would be something i would like to work on more. 

**Future Features -**
In the future i would love to develop this app out more with more relatant information pertaining to the game of Dungeons and Dragons, as well as other helpful features such as a dice roller, and a searchable database.

**Final thoughts -**
It was great to get designs into a fully functioning site and explore the relationship between the back and front ends. It was a lot of fun to explore designs on a fully fledged site.
